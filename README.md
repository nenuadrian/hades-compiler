## Overview

Compiler for a custom language, Hades, to JVM byte-code using ANTLR for parsing as an opportunity to explore the inner-depth of compiler prototyping methodology.

The new language is not expected to beat any other in any meaningul way in terms of syntax or performance, but I might focus on bringing different capabilities from different languages experimentally.


I use ANTLR as it is quite commonly known and leveraged by production languages and we can find definition files for them such as:
  * Dart: https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/dart2/
  * Swift: https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/swift/swift3/Swift3.g4
  * Countlness others: https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master

## Purpose

The primary goal is to create a basic compiler capable of solving simple LeetCode problems and scripting-level programs. This is an educational passion project to understand compiler construction, not intended for production use or to solve a direct problem with other languages.

## Compiler Design

The compiler will follow a a fairly traditional structure:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down the source code into tokens.
2. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Converting tokens into an AST.
3. **Code Generation**: Translating the AST into byte-code/assembly/executable code.

## Syntax

Hello world example:

```
hero a = 2; # variable
hero b = 3; # variable
styx a; # prints a
bestow a; # returns a
```

Defined in src/main/antlr/Hades.g4.
